machine_interpretable,function,"A function is a relation that uniquely associates members of one set with members of another set. More formally, a function from  A to B is an object f  such that every a in A  is uniquely associated with an object f(a) in B. A function is therefore a many-to-one (or sometimes one-to-one) relation.",http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Function.html

machine_interpretable,oop_class," The definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type or class of object; may also contain data and procedures (known as class methods) themselves, i.e. classes contain the data members and member functions.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming
machine_interpretable,oop_object,An instance of an (oop) class.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming

machine_interpretable,oop_instance_method,"A method that belongs to individual objects, and has access to instance variables for the specific object they are called on, inputs, and class variables.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming
machine_interpretable,oop_class_attribute,An attribute/variable belong to the class as a whole; there is only one copy of each one.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming
machine_interpretable,oop_instance_attribute,An attribute/value that belongs to individual objects; every object has its own copy of each one.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming
machine_interpretable,program,A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program
machine_interpretable,primitve_data_type,"A primitive type is a concrete type whose data consists of plain old bits. Classic examples of primitive types are integers and floating-point values. Unlike most languages, Julia lets you declare your own primitive types, rather than providing only a fixed set of built-in ones. ",https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/index.html#Primitive-Types-1
machine_interpretable,data_structure,"In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of datavalues, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure
machine_interpretable,control_flow_statement,"A control flow statement is a statement, the execution of which results in a choice being made as to which of two or more paths to follow.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow
machine_interpretable,local_variable,"In computer science, a local variable is a variable that is given local scope. Local variable references in the function or block in which it is declared override the same variable name in the larger scope.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_variable
machine_interpretable,global_variable,"In computer programming, a global variable is a variable with global scope, meaning that it is visible (hence accessible) throughout the program, unless shadowed. The set of all global variables is known as the global environment or global state. ",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_variable
machine_interpretable,numeric_value,A quantitative value.,
domain_interpretable ,unit,"A unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a quantity, defined and adopted by convention or by law, that is used as a standard for measurement of the same kind of quantity.[1] Any other quantity of that kind can be expressed as a multiple of the unit of measurement.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement
domain_interpretable ,untiful_aggregation,"A collection (n>1) of objects measured in (and/or convertible to, through dimensional analysis) a specific unit.",
domain_interpretable ,independent_variable,"A variable manipulated by an experimenter is called an independent variable. Depending on the context, an independent variable is sometimes called a ""predictor variable"", regressor, covariate, ""controlled variable"", ""manipulated variable"", ""explanatory variable"", exposure variable (see reliability theory), ""risk factor"" (see medical statistics), ""feature"" (in machine learning and pattern recognition) or ""input variable.""] In econometrics, the term ""control variable"" is usually used instead of ""covariate"".",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables

domain_interpretable ,mathematical_model,"A mathematical model is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language. A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behaviour.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model
domain_interpretable ,concept,"A scientific or mathematical idea, mental representation, abstract object, etc. Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed ""superordinate"" and lower levels termed ""subordinate"". Additionally, there is the ""basic"" or ""middle"" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept
