Our philosophy is that over the next few decades, the adoption of computation as a first class pillar of scientific thought will be complete, and scientists will do a majority of their thinking about and communicating of ideas in the form of writing and using code. Attempts to teach machines science based on reading texts intended for human consumption is overwhelming, so we use text written for computers as a starting point. This involves extracting meaning from code, and reconciling such information with exogenous sources of information about the world.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"SemanticModels.jl","title":"SemanticModels.jl","text":"Scientists typically write procedural code based on libraries for solving mathematical models. When this procedural code is expressed in data-oriented pipelines or workflows, such workflows have limited composability. The most mature scientific field in terms of data-oriented workflows is bioinformatics, where practicing informaticists spend a great deal of time plumbing together procedural scripts and adapting data formats. Automatic adaptation of modeling codes requires a semantic understanding of the model that the code implements/computes. SemanticModels.jl is intended to augment scientists' modeling capabilities by extracting semantic information and facilitating different types of model manipulation and generation.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"SemanticModels.jl","title":"SemanticModels.jl","text":"We focus on three problems:","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"SemanticModels.jl","title":"SemanticModels.jl","text":"Model augmentation: taking an existing model and modifying its components to add features or make comparisons.\nMetamodel construction: combining models or components of models to automatically generate scientific computing workflows.\nModel Verification: given a model, corpus of previous applications of that model, and an input to the model, detect if the model is properly functioning.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"SemanticModels.jl","title":"SemanticModels.jl","text":"SemanticModels leverages technology from program analysis and natural language processing in order to build a knowledge graph representing the connections between elements of code (variables, values, functions, and expressions) and elements of scientific understanding (concepts, terms, relations).

This semantic constraint that all variables named t_ are temporal variables is not encoded in the type system because all those variables are still floats. Another example is that vectors of different lengths are incompatible. In a compartment model, the number of initial conditions must match the number of compartments, and the number of parameters may be different. For example in an SIR model there are 3 initial conditions, SIR and there are 2 parameters beta gamma. These vectors are incompatible, you cannot perform arithmetic or comparisons on them directly.

It was authored by Uri Wilensky in 1999 and has been in continuous development ever since at the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling. NetLogo is particularly well suited for modeling complex systems developing over time. Modelers can give instructions to hundreds or thousands of \"agents\" all operating independently. This makes it possible to explore the connection between the micro-level behavior of individuals and the macro-level patterns that emerge from their interaction. NetLogo lets students open simulations and \"play\" with them, exploring their behavior under various conditions. It is also an authoring environment which enables students, teachers and curriculum developers to create their own models. NetLogo is simple enough for students and teachers, yet advanced enough to serve as a powerful tool for researchers in many fields. NetLogo has extensive documentation and tutorials. It also comes with the Models Library, a large collection of pre-written simulations that can be used and modified. These simulations address content areas in the natural and social sciences including biology and medicine, physics and chemistry, mathematics and computer science, and economics and social psychology. Several model-based inquiry curricula using NetLogo are available and more are under development. NetLogo is the next generation of the series of multi-agent modeling languages including StarLogo and StarLogoT. NetLogo runs on the Java Virtual Machine, so it works on all major platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux, et al). It is run as a desktop application. Command line operation is also supported. [@tisue2004netlogo; @nlweb] NetLogo has been widely used by the simulation research community at-large for well over nearly two decades. Although there is a rich literature that mentions its use, it may be more difficult to identify scripts that have been authored and that pair with published research papers using the modeling library due to the amount of time that has passed and that researcher may no longer monitor the email addresses listed on their publications for various reasons.","category":"page"},{"location":"approach/#EMOD-1","page":"Approaches","title":"EMOD","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"approach/#","page":"Approaches","title":"Approaches","text":"Epidemiological MODeling (EMOD) is an open-source agent-based modeling software package developed by the Institute for Disease Modeling (IDM), and written in C++ [@emodRepo; @emodDocs].

This will require some manual annotation of data from artifacts and   quality measures such as precision and recall. The precision is the   number of edges in the knowledge graph that are correct, and the   recall is the fraction of correct edges that were recovered by the   information extraction approach.\nMetamodel construction: once we have a knowledge graph, we will   need to ensure that combinations of metamodels are valid, and   optimal. We will aim to produce the simpliest metamodel that relates   the queried concepts this will be measured in terms of number of   metamodel nodes, number of metamodel dependency onnections, number   of adjustment or transformation functions. We will design test cases   that increase in complexity from pipelines with no need to transform   variables, to pipelines with variable transformations, to directed   acyclic graphs (DAGs).\nModel Accuracy: as the metamodels are combinations of models that   are imperfect, there will be compounding error within the metamodel.   We will need to validate that our metamodel execution engine does   not add error unnecessarily. This will involve numerical accuracy   related to finite precision arithmetic, as well as statistical   accuracy related to the ability to learn parameters from data.   Additionally, since we are by necessity doing some amount of domain   adaptation when reusing models, we will need to quantify the domain   adaptation error generated by applying a model developed for one   context in a different context. These components of errors can be   thought of as compounding loss in a signal processing system where   each component of the design introduces loss with a different   response to the input.","category":"page"},{"location":"approach/#","page":"Approaches","title":"Approaches","text":"Our view is to analogize the metamodel construction error and the model accuracy to the error and residual in numerical solvers. For a given root finding problem, such as f(x)=0 solve for x the most common way to measure the quality of the solution is to measure both the error and the residual. The error is defined as mid x-x^starmid, which is the difference from the correct solution in the domain of x and the residual is mid f(x) - f(x^star)mid or the difference from the correct solution in the codomain.

In addition, we expect the differences between our hand-produced meta-model and our system-produced meta-model to be informative and interpretable as feedback which can help us to improve the system architecture and associated user experience. It's also worth noting that over the medium term, we anticipate that holes in the knowledge graph (e.g., missing vertices and/or edges; missing conversion steps to go from one unit of analysis to another, etc.) may help us to highlight areas where either additional research, and/or expert human input is
